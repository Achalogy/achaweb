Interactive platform to prepare for the university entrance exam in Colombia called ICFES.

The objective of this platform is to encourage the preparation of 11th grade students, who are about to complete their high school studies and will soon enter university.

Although the main focus of the website is the ICFES, it has texts, materials, tests and more to practice many of the important skills of Mathematics, English, Critical Reading, Social and Natural Sciences, as well as subtopics of these subjects. Among some of these is the preparation for the National University exam.
