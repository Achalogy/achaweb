Designed and built an intuitive web platform that allows users to catalog and track their Pokémon TCG card collections. Implemented features to mark cards as "owned" and track the quantity of each card in a streamlined interface. Developed a scalable backend with MongoDB for storing user data and collection details efficiently. Ensured seamless deployment and reliable performance using Docker and Nginx in a Linux environment.

Currently expanding functionality to include community-driven features, such as trading and collection sharing, to foster a collaborative user experience.
